# OpenGL_Deferred_Renderer

Unzip the "libraries.zip" file and place the two folders (include and lib) in ./OpenGL_Deferred_Renderer/ folder along with "main.cpp".

Have Visual Studio installed and open and run the .sln file. It should run.

Tested on RTX3080:

It seems to be able to render about 280 point lights + 1 shadow casting directional light at 4K (3840x2160) 60 fps.
It seems to be able to render about 780 point lights + 1 shadow casting directional light at 1080p (1920x1080) 60 fps.
